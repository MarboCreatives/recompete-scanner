Canadian Recompete Radar - ingest pipeline
==========================================

Pulls federal contract award records from the Government of Canada open data
portal, normalizes them, deduplicates amendments, and derives the recompete
signal (which contracts expire when, held by whom, how contested).

Source : Proactive Publication - Contracts (contracts over $10,000)
         open.canada.ca CKAN datastore, resource fac950c0-00d5-4ec1-a4d3-9cbebf98a305
Licence: Open Government Licence - Canada
Volume : ~1.31M rows total; the recompete window is a small subset.

FIELD SEMANTICS (verified against the published TBS schema):
  delivery_date        "Contract Period End Date or Delivery Date"
                       For SERVICES contracts this is the end date of the period
                       over which services are provided -> the contract end date.
                       For GOODS it is a delivery date that only *may* be the end
                       date, so goods are excluded from the recompete view by default.
  contract_period_start  Start of the performance period.
  number_of_bids       How many bidders competed. 100% populated on recent data.
  solicitation_procedure / limited_tendering_reason  Competed vs sole-sourced.
  procurement_id       Joins award records back to the originating tender notice.

Usage
-----
  python3 ingest.py --self-test              # validate transforms on bundled fixture
  python3 ingest.py --full                   # full historical load -> recompete.db
  python3 ingest.py --window 24              # only contracts expiring within 24 months

# Everything above and below this block is the site's file, byte for byte. The

# touched, which is what lets drift.py compare the functions here against the
# site's current main and refuse the run if any of them has moved.
#
# The whole file is copied rather than the parts the scanner uses. A trimmed
# copy makes every future re-copy a judgement about what to keep, and the
# re-copy is meant to be a diff anyone can read. M2-DESIGN 4.2 calls updating
# the copy "a normal pull request"; that only holds if the diff is small.
#
# main() is NOT called by the scanner. It writes recompete_pipeline.json and a
# SQLite file to disk, and M2-DESIGN 7 says the pipeline file is never
# committed, cached or uploaded as an artifact. scan.py calls iter_all_rows,
# normalize, collect_refs, deduplicate and filter_recompete directly and keeps
# the rows in memory.

    # into the pipeline JSON, into the published workflow artifact, into the
    # SQLite file. Not collecting it is the only version of "we don't publish it"
